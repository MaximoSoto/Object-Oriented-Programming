# Lab 3

The goal of this lab is to learn how to read a UML diagram and use it to implement its member variables and functions. In addition, the ideas of accessibility and encapsulation will be used. The final goal of the lab is to learn how separate files into header files (.h), source files (.cpp), and test files (main.cpp).
