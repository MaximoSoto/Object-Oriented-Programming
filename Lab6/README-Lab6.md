# Lab 6

## Objective
The goal of this lab was to create a functioning game loop incorporating the RPG class to have a battle loop that would 
leave 1 object from the RPG class standing. The learning goals were to learn how to create methods with parameters that take in pointers.
In addition, the difference between pass by value and pass by reference will be further expanded upon by iterating upon the class object
from the previous lab.
